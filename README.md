## Battery situation

* We burned first set of batteries on 8.6.2019, expenses even to both parties.
* Second set of batteries now in use, cost by Zeick. (It's quite frustrating how quickly the voltage drops ðŸ˜¢)
* Next set of batteries will be provided by Urbanautti.

## 8.6.2019
We are using [EV3 Python manual](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3devpython/learn_ev3_python/using-motors) as a useful resource.

## 26.5.2019
Both participants are at an equipoise with their python course
Also we have agreed that the next eevee3 run will add a distance sensor input to the existing program script. 

## 19.5.2019
We managed to get the robot move a square. In the future we will apply sensor data.
