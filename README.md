# EV3-project

## Battery situation

* We burned first set of batteries on 8.6.2019, expenses even to both parties.
* Second set of batteries now in use, cost by Zeick. (It's quite frustrating how quickly the voltage drops ðŸ˜¢)
* Current set of batteries (as of 26.07.2019) is still functional)
* Next set of batteries will be provided by Urbanautti.


## 25.7.2019

We ran a successful trial with the EV3 color sensor. 
We removed the INCEPTION soundbyte file(at last). 
The trial run using the color sensor was measuring the levels of light intensity.
FURTHER NOTE! LEST WE FORGET! The procedure for printing the data on the VSC terminal panel requires:
from sys import stderr
and juxtaposed to print function WRITE , end=' ', file = stderr
ONE MORE THING! When check EV3 page for instructions make sure you have the instruction for the MATCHING version of python (https://sites.google.com/site/ev3devpython/learn_ev3_python/using-sensors)

## 8.6.2019
We are using [EV3 Python manual](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3devpython/learn_ev3_python/using-motors) as a useful resource.
We have finally removed the old soundbyte files from the ev3 brick.
We were able to incorporate the infrared proximity sensor to the eevee chassis.
After a myriad of trial-and-error test runs, we were able to get the the eevee robot to react and respond to obstacles. 

Notes: Proximity of 40 is 30cm, the ev3 brick needs to be connected and visual code rebooted to make connection. 

Suggestions have been made to incorporate the pressure sensor for a "Secondary protocol program".  

## 26.5.2019
Both participants are at an equipoise with their python course
Also we have agreed that the next eevee3 run will add a distance sensor input to the existing program script. 

## 19.5.2019
We managed to get the robot move a square. In the future we will apply sensor data.
